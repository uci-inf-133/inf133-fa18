        p Welcome! This class focuses on the programming and development of user interfaces, with a specific focus on modern web and mobile technology. We'll cover HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, and Ionic along the way, growing an understanding of what each of these technologies provides and affords. Coming out of this class, students should be able to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of different devices and development frameworks for a given task.
